# Unit 13 - "ROBOADVISOR" challenge

For Unit 13 assignment, we had the option of choosing one of 2 challenges, RoboAdvisor and ClusteringCrypto. I have chosen the RoboAdvisor challenge.

In this homework assignment, we combined our new Amazon Web Services skills with Python, and created a bot that will recommend an investment portfolio for a retirement plan. The following GIF shows our initial RoboAdvisor configuration, building and testing of the RoboAdvisor, as well as, the inclusion of the Lambda Function to enhance the RoboAdvisor.
